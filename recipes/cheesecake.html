  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>Crust</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups (150g) graham cracker crumbs(about 10 whole graham crackers, crushed)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup (28g) confectioners' sugar</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons (85g) butter, melted</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Filing</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>2 8-ounce pacakges (452g) cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
    <li>2/3 cup (133g) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9", 
    and whose height is at least 1 1/4". Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
    <li><strong>To make the crust:</strong> Stir together all of the crust ingredients, 
    mixing until throughly combined.</li>
    <li>Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, 
    making a thicker layer on the bottom than on the sides.</li>
    <li><strong>To make the filling:</strong> Mix together the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth. 
    To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer set at low-medium speed. 
    To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature.</li>
    <li>Set the pie pan onto a baking sheet, if desired; this makes it easier to transport in and out of the oven, and also protects the bottom of the crust from any potential scorching. 
    Pour the filling into the crust.</li>
    <li><strong>To bake the cheesecake:</strong> Place the cheesecake in the oven. 
    Bake it for 20 minutes, then add a crust shield; or shield the crust with strips of aluminum foil. 
    Bake for an additional 10 minutes (for a total of about 30 minutes). 
    A digital thermometer inserted into the filling 1" from the edge should read between 165°F and 170°F; the filling won't look entirely set in the center.</li>
    <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and set it on a rack to cool. 
    Once the cake is cool, refrigerate it, covered, until you're ready to serve it.</li>
    <li>Serve cheesecake in wedges, with fresh fruit if desired.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage information:</strong> Store and leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator for several days; freeze for longer storage.</li>
    </ol>
