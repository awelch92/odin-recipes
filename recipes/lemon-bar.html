  <p>These shortbread crust lemon bars are one of my favorite cookies of all time â€” although technically, they're closer to a pie than a cookie. 
  Nothing prepares you for that intense, awesome sweet and tart lemon-flavored custard, perfectly contrasted against crisp, sweet, buttery shortbread cookie.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <h3>Shortbread Crust:</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter at room temperature</li>
    <li>1/4 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
   </ul>

  <h3>Lemon Custard:</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 large egg yolks</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all purpose-flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest</li>
   </ul>
  
  <h3>Garnish:</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>1 teaspooon confectioners' sugar, or to taste</li>
   </ul>
  
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
   <ol>
    <p><li>Set an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
    Lightly grease an 8x8-inch baking dish.
    <p><li><strong>Make crust:</strong> Use the back of a spatula or wooden spoon to mash flour and butter in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. 
    Mix in confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and salt until mixture resembles slightly crumbly cookie dough. 
    Moisten your fingers with a little water and press dough into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. 
    Use a fork to prick holes all over crust.</li></p>
    <p><li>Bake on the middle rack in the preheated oven until edges are barely golden brown, about 22 minutes. Set aside.</li></p>
    <p><li>Make custard: Beat together eggs and egg yolks in a medium bowl until combined. 
    Whisk in white sugar and flour until smooth. 
    Add lemon juice and zest; whisk for 2 minutes. Pour over warm crust.</li></p>
    <p><li>Bake on the center rack until custard is set and the top has a thin white sugary crust, about 25 minutes. 
    Let cool completely before cutting into bars.</li></p>
    <p><li>Dip a knife into very hot water, then run the blade around the edges and cut into 16 squares. 
    Dust bars with confectioners' sugar.</li></p>
